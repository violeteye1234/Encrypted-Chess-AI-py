Establishing a LAN connection
As you mentioned, we can use the 'LAN_INTERFACE.py' module to establish a connection between the two players. 
We will need to modify this module to send and receive data related to the chess game. Once a connection has been established, we can move on to step 2.

Creating the Chess GUI
We can use the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface for the chess game. We will need to display the chess board, the current player's turn, and any captured pieces.
 We will also need to handle user input, such as clicking a piece to select it and clicking again to move it to a valid square. 
 The GUI should be intuitive and easy to use.

Implementing the Chess Logic
We will need to implement the rules of chess to allow players to make valid moves. This includes checking if a move is legal, handling checks and checkmates, 
and determining when the game ends in a draw. We will also need to keep track of the state of the game, including the positions of all the pieces and any captured pieces.

Synchronizing the Game State
To synchronize the game state between the two players, we can use the LAN connection established in step 1 to send and receive data about the game state. 
Whenever a player makes a move, we will send this move to the other player, who will update their local copy of the game state accordingly. We can do this in real-time to 
ensure that both players have an accurate view of the game at all times.

Allowing Players to Choose their Preferred Colour
We can allow players to choose their preferred colour by displaying a dialog box at the start of the game. Each player can select their preferred colour, 
and the game will begin with the appropriate starting positions for each player's pieces.
